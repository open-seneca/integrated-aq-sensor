## What you need:
- Screwdriver
- Scissors

## List of materials:
- Colourful sticker
- PCB
- SPS30 sensor
- Sensor box:
  - 1000mAh battery
  - Male bike mount
- Cardboard pouch:
  - Female bike mount
  - 5-pin SPS cable
  - 4x M3 Sensor box screw
  - 4x Rubber bands
  - 4x Nylon PCB Screw
  - Sensor box seal
  - Display
  - GPS antenna
  - SD card
 - Micro USB charging cable (not included)

### This tutorial will take you through 10 steps to assemble the open-seneca air quality sensor kit:
1) Lay out all the components in front of you, place the display face down inside the cutout of the grey box.

2) If not provided, deposited double-sided foam adhesive. Then peel off to fix the battery and the GPS antenna. It is important to place the battery and GPS antenna excatly as shown in the photo for the cables to run inside the box!

3) Plug the two cables into the connectors on the PCB and make sure the GPS cable comes up from the right corner, the battery cable from the left. You can guide these on the outside of the PCB spacers. Carfully, slide the PCB down into the display pins.

4) You can now press the power button to check if the display turns on.

5) Lock the SD card into place by pushing the frame horizontally until you hear a click.

6) Now, screw down the PCB with 4 nylon/plastic M3 screws provided. If you were supplied with metal screws (as shown in this photo) use only 3 screws and leave out the one by the power button.

7) You can not plug in the Sensirion particulate matter sensor using the provided black 5pin cable. The lid opening will align with the sensor's venting holes.

8) Prepare the lid by placing the white seal inside the rim and cut off the excess.

9) Attach the Sensirion sensor to the transparent lid using double sided tape (provided). The footprint position for the sensor is indicated as a white line on the PCB. Please do *not* peel off the protective film around the Sensirion sensor. Close the lid and make sure you do not trap any cables.

10) Finally, fix the self-adhesive bike mount piece centrally on the outside of the transparent lid.


**Note: Your sensor will come with a colourful sticker to attach to the display side. We advise to turn on the sensor first and align the sticker window with the display area :)**
